# Two games

This is a repo of an assignment I did in the JavaScript Program at Davis Tech.


###  **Coin toss**

The classic *heads* or *tails* guessing game.
First you click either *heads* or *tails*.

The program then generates a 1 or 0 randomly:
```JavaScript
Math.round(Math.random());
```
a `1` represents *heads* and a `0` represents *tails*.

If the button you clicked matches up it adds one to your *win* tally, if not it adds one to your *lose* tally.

  

###  **Number Guessing game**

This game is my favorite of the two. The rules are slightly more complicated than the coin toss

- You have 10 tries to find a number between 1 - 100

- If you guess too low it tells you that your guess was too low.

- If you guess too high it tells you that your guess was too high.

- If you guess the number, you win!

- If you're out of guesses you lose.
